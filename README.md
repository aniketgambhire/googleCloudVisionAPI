Complete guide on How to setup and use Google Cloud Vision API


Before we start we will see some information about google cloud vision API. Using What, and Why questions.
What is Google Cloud Vision API?
Google Cloud Vision API is a machine learning service that is provided by google cloud platform and this API allows developers to basically integrate vision detection features into their applications like facial recognition, OCR, image labeling and tagging of explicit content.

Why use Vision API?
These are easy to use rest APIs and easy to learn. And they offers most powerful pre-trained machine learning models through the REST and RPC APIs.

Now we know what Google Cloud Vision API is and why to use it, we can start with setup of vision api for our project-
Create Project -
To use Google Cloud Services we must create a project for that visit Google Cloud Console, it is a web UI used to provision, configure, manage and monitor systems that use Google Cloud products.
In the Google cloud console, on the project selector page, select or create aGoogle Cloud Project. A project organizes all your Google Cloud resources and consists of the following components:
a set of collaborators
enabled APIs (and other resources)
monitoring tools
billing information
authentication and access controls
Enable Billing -
Create a billing account and configure it for our project. You can check billing is enabled for project here

Enable API - 
You must enable Vision API for your project. Documentation for Enabling the Vision API

Create Credentials - 
To access Vision APIs we must configure credentials. There are 2 ways we can create credentials using API key or using authentication token.
We can create credentials under API & Services

Once you are done with all above steps we can start using Google Cloud Vision API.
